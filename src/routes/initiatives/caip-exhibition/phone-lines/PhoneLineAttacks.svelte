				<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Weaponization of AI-Driven Voice Emulation</h2>
				<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
					Advanced AI-driven voice emulation represents a significant security threat when combined with automated calling systems. Our demonstration showcases how malicious actors could leverage state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) technology and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic voices capable of conducting human-like conversations at scale.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					This proof-of-concept system demonstrates the full attack chain: from scraping publicly available business data across targeted areas, to aggregating context from sources like Google and Yelp, to conducting real-time adaptive conversations. The platform can automatically place calls to businesses and government offices, highlighting the urgent need for protective measures against such potential attacks.
