			We think that reducing risks from advanced artificial intelligence may be one of the most
			important problems of our time. We also think itâ€™s a highly interesting and exciting problem,
			with open opportunities for many more researchers to make progress on it.<br /><br />
			MAIA supports undergraduate and graduate students in conducting research relevant to reducing risks
			from advanced AI. <br /><br />We also run a semester-long introductory reading group on AI
			safety, including both a technical machine learning track and a policy track.
