		MAIA, in partnership with the Cambridge Boston Alignment Initiative (<a
			href="https://www.cbai.ai/">CBAI</a
		>), hosts <a href="https://www.cbai.ai/ml-bootcamp">ML Bootcamps</a> outside of semester time, aimed
		at quickly getting students up to speed in deep learning and developing skills useful for conducting
		AI safety research in the real world.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-2 mb-2">
		The bootcamps are in-person, with teaching assistants experienced with ML and AI safety
		research. We follow the highly-rated MLAB (Machine Learning for Alignment) curriculum designed
		by Redwood Research, which provides a <b
			>thorough, hands-on introduction to state-of-the-art ML techniques</b
		> (e.g. transformers, deep RL, mechanistic interpretability) and is meant to get you to the level
		of replicating ML papers in PyTorch. The programâ€™s only prerequisites are comfort with Python and
		introductory linear algebra.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-2 mb-8">
		We may run a bootcamp in January 2025, please <a
