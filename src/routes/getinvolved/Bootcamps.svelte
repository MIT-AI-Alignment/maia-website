		MAIA, in partnership with the Cambridge Boston Alignment Initiative 
		(<a href="https://www.cbai.ai/">CBAI</a>), hosts 
		<a href="https://www.cbai.ai/ml-bootcamp">ML Bootcamps</a> outside of semester time, aimed
		at quickly getting students up to speed in deep learning and developing skills useful for conducting
		AI safety research in the real world.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-2 mb-2">
		The bootcamp is <a href="https://www.cbai.ai/ml-bootcamp">CAMBRIA</a> (Cambridge Bootcamp for Research in Interpretability and Alignment).
		It is in-person, with teaching assistants experienced with ML and AI safety
		research. We follow the highly-rated ARENA curriculum designed provides a 
		<b>thorough, hands-on introduction to state-of-the-art ML techniques</b> 
		(e.g. transformers, deep RL, mechanistic interpretability) and is meant to get you to the level
		of replicating ML papers in PyTorch. The program’s only prerequisites are comfort with Python and
		introductory linear algebra.
