		The machine learning track of AI Safety Fundamentals is a seven-week research-oriented reading
		group on <b>technical AI safety</b>. Topics covered include
		<a

			class="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-300"
		>
			neural network interpretability</a
		>,
		<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155" class="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-300">
			learning from human feedback</a
		>,
		<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111" class="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-300">
			goal misgeneralization in reinforcement learning settings</a
		>, and
		<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001" class="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-300">
			potential catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems</a
		>. The program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Students with machine
		learning experience are especially encouraged to apply, although
		<b>no prior experience is required</b>.

	<p class="mt-2">
		Participants meet weekly in small sections facilitated by a TA that is a graduate student or an
		upperclassman with experience in AI safety research. Dinner is provided, and no work is assigned
		outside of weekly meetings. Our curriculum is based on
