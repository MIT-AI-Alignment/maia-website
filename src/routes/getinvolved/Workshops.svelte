		Every semester, MAIA and the AI Student Safety Team at Harvard (<a href="http://haist.ai"
			>AISST</a
		>) collaborate to run weekend workshops on AI safety. We gather students, professors, and
		professionals working on AI safety to discuss and collaborate on the cutting edge of AI safety
		research and policy. 
		<br><br>
		In the past, we have run workshops building transformers from scratch,
		replicating papers in the field, and learning from industry leaders.
